# Fluid Framework FAST Examples Repository

This codebase includes examples of collaborative applications built with the Fluid Framework and [FAST web components](https://www.fast.design/). For documentation about the Fluid Framework, go to https://FluidFramework.com. The Fluid Framework repository lives at https://github.com/Microsoft/FluidFramework.

Each example is a standalone application that defines a Fluid Container and loads it into a webpage. To get started, clone the repo, go into an example folder that you want to run, and follow the instructions in the example's `readme.md` file.
